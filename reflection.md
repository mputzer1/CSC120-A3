When working on this assignment, I met with Bobi on February 12th at 8:20 PM. While working with Bobi, I was able to solve the I/Me/You and the your/my problem using temporary variables called tempyour and tempyou. I began to understand how I can treat strings differently, even if they externally look the same. I also met with Paola during TA hours on February 14th at 7:30 PM. While working with Paola, I figured out that the contains command doesn't acknowledge regex and that I need to create an array that would be split where I could store the user answer and check for word containment. I would advise future students to meet with other students during the coding process so that they can compare methods sooner and not spend lots of time on methods that don't work. If I would have done this, I think I would have spent less time trying to make .contains work. I also talked to Jo from the morning class period about how to remove punctuation from the computer response. She showed me her code and we compared how we approached the assignment differently, especially in relation to how we dealt with looking for containment in answers.

Ultimately, my initial impressions of Java are that it is somewhat annoying because you constantly have to declare variable types. Additionally, what would take a few characters in Python, such as the print command, requires a lot more in Java. I'm still a little confused about how the public static void main works and why it is needed in addition to how classes function. I feel like I can draw a few conclusions about programming in general, such as pseudocode is very helpful, regardless of the language you are programming in. Most languages can be used to create what you want to create, so having an outline described in a natural language is very useful. While Java might take an object-oriented rather than procedural approach (like Python sometimes does), they also both require you to think about processes you can visualize in terms of characters you might have never heard of.

The following are sources I consulted to learn about how Java functions.
